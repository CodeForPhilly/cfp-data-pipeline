# Code for Philly (CfP) Data Pipeline

This repo holds Code for Philly's data pipeline.
It allows us to report metrics involving our slack, github, and codeforphilly.org website data.

We want this pipeline to be helpful to other CfP projects, by..

* Using data that CfP members can already access.
* Exploring and documenting different pipeline tools.
* Emphasizing approaches that CfP projects find useful.
